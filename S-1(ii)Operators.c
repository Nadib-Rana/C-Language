// Arithmetic Operators: Used for mathematical operations like +, -, *, /, %.

// Relational Operators: Used to compare values, such as ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=.

// Logical Operators: Used to combine multiple conditions, such as &&, ||, !.

int a = 10, b = 5;
int sum = a + b;  // Arithmetic operator
int isEqual = (a == b);  // Relational operator
int logical = (a > 5 && b < 10);  // Logical operator
